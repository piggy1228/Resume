\bf Streaming Music Service (Python)\hfill{\it Apr-May. 2019}\rm\\
\vspace{-4mm}
\begin{list2}
\item Designed and implemented a protocol to build a streaming music service for multiple clients via TCP
\item Client could retrieve a list of songs that are available on the server, play the song with specified song id or name, download songs after receiving all the data, switch and stop songs
simulaneously
\end{list2}




\bf PennCloud (C/C++)\hfill{\it Oct-Dec. 2018}\rm\\
\vspace{-4mm}
\begin{list2}
\item Built a cloud platform with its webmail and storage service, analogous to Gmail and Google Drive
\item A set of frontend servers can be accessed with browsers and users are able to interact with the services
\item  A distributed storage system in the backend, home to storage of all state and key-value store abstractions, is built to guarantee the consistency of storage by achieving load balancing and fault tolerance
\end{list2}

\bf  Food for thought (Full stack)\hfill{\it Oct-Dec. 2018}\rm\\
\vspace{-4mm}
\begin{list2}
\item Developed a webpage which recommends Airbnb homes in NYC to users based on their food 
preference and food options in the neighborhoods, with data from Airbnb and Yelp, stored on cloud hosting (AWS) 
\item Users are able to customize their home preferences, including price range and choice of neighborhood 
\item Results are shown on Google Maps, where users are able to be directed to webpages of  the Airbnb homes, as well as nearby restaurants. Altogether, users can integrate food and homes into plans,  and bookmark them in their accounts
\end{list2}
